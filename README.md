# Forward and Backward Feature Selection with Nearest Neighbor
This repository showcases the implementation of Forward and Backward Feature Selection using the Nearest Neighbor algorithm as part of the Artificial Intelligence (CS205) class project. The project's main objective is to explore the effectiveness of feature selection techniques in improving the performance of the Nearest Neighbor classifier.

# The project encompasses the following key tasks:

Nearest Neighbor Implementation: The Nearest Neighbor algorithm is coded up to serve as the foundation for subsequent feature selection techniques.

Feature Search using Nearest Neighbor: The Nearest Neighbor algorithm is utilized within a "wrapper" to perform feature selection using two different approaches: Forward Selection and Backward Elimination.

Processing Synthetic Datasets: Three synthetic datasets of increasing sizes are processed to evaluate the impact of feature selection on classification accuracy.

Processing Real-world Classification Dataset: A real-world classification dataset is employed to assess the effectiveness of the Nearest Neighbor algorithm with feature selection.

Report: A comprehensive information is provided, detailing the methodology, experimental setup, results, and insights gained from the project.
